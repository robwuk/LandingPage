    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have been an IT Project Manager for over 15 years but was originally a developer (mid->late '90s). As part of my personal development, I am revisiting coding using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as languages and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> as my version management tool. My long term goal is to move back in to  front-end development.</br></br>
    The below pages are the projects I am currently working on, one being  development site for the church I attend (and whose website I maintain) and the second being the area I try new skills/techniques in.
