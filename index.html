      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have been an IT Project Manager for over 15 years but was originally a developer (mid->late '90s). As part of my personal development, I am revisiting coding using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as languages and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> as my version management tool. My long term goal is to move back in to  front-end development.</br></br>
      The below pages are the projects I am currently working on, one being  development site for the church I attend (and whose website I maintain) and the second being the area I try new skills/techniques in.</br></br>
      Feel free to have a look at my work - as I develop I will add a feedback mechanism to this page if you want to get in touch.
      </p>
      <p>In order to learn, I am following the <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a> philosphy and using <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank">SoloLearn</a> as my training platform. So far I have completed:
        <ul>
          <li>HTML Fundametals</li>
          <li>CSS Fundamentals</li>
        </ul>
        and am working on the JavaScript Tutorial.
